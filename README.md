   If you don't have Python installed, download it from the official website [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Follow the instructions based on your operating system.

2. **Install Required Libraries:**
   Open your command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux) and run the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
   ```

3. **Download the Application:**
   To download the latest version, visit [this page to download](https://github.com/Hadefolarin/particle-physics-handtracking/releases). Find the appropriate file for your operating system and download it.

4. **Extract the Files:**
   After downloading, locate the downloaded file. Right-click on it and choose to extract it. This will create a folder with all the necessary files.

5. **Navigate to the Folder:**
   Open your command prompt or terminal again and navigate to the folder where you extracted the application files. You can use the `cd` command to change directories.

6. **Run the Application:**
   Once you are in the correct folder, execute the application with this command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 🎨 Using the Application
After running the application, you will see a window displaying the particle simulation. Follow these simple steps to control the particles:

- **Setup Your Camera:** Ensure that your camera is on and positioned correctly to capture your hand gestures.
- **Start Moving Your Hands:** Use gestures to interact with the particles. The application recognizes different hand movements to manipulate the simulations.
- **Enjoy the Experience:** Feel free to explore and experiment with the various gestures to see how they affect the particle system!

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues while running the application, try the following:

- **Camera Not Detected:** Make sure your camera is functioning and that you have granted permissions.
- **Libraries Not Found:** Double-check that you have installed all the required libraries. You can repeat the installation command if necessary.
- **Simulation Lag:** Ensure that no other high-load applications are running simultaneously.
